        <h1><b>The State of Michigan</b></h1>
       <section class="intro"><p>From the Great Lakes shores to the scenery of the Upper Peninsula, the state of Michigan sees a sizable amount of snow through the season. In this section, we will dive into the patterns and significance of snowfall in Michigan, uncovering how much snow the state will prepare for.</p>

        <p>Snowflakes dancing over the expanse of Michigan’s lakes, turning the shores to White.</p>
        <p>Lake-effect snow is a prominent occurrence in Michigan, when cold air passes over the warmer waters of the Great Lakes, picking up moisture which leads to intense snowfall when it reaches the colder land.</p>
        <p>This effect is particularly pronounced on the Eastern and Western shores of the state.</p>
        <p> Cities on the Eastern side and Western areas near Lake Michigan often witness increased snowfall due to this process.</p>
        <p>In southern Michigan, the snowfall is typically less extreme but still significant.</p>
        <p>Storm systems moving across the central part of the United States can bring widespread snowfall to the entire state</p>
        <p> These systems, combined with the lake-effect snow in certain regions, contribute to the overall snowfall patterns.</p>

        <P>This Graphic made by the National Weather Service shows a map of the state before and after the week of January 18th</P>
        <P>As you observe the map, you’ll notice that the cities of the state that are near the coast faced a larger sum of precipitation. This is due to the Lake effect </P>
        <p>The seasonal transition from fall to winter in Michigan is marked by a gradual decrease in temperatures, leading to the first snowfalls</p>
        <p>As winter progresses, intermittent storms and lake-effect snow events can bring varying amounts of snowfall to different parts of the state</p>

        <p>The graphic above shows the amount of snowfall from the 2021-2022 season compared to the most recent 2022-2023 season.</p>
        <p>It appears that the state had warmer weather, but managed to have positive trends in snowfall in most areas. </p>
        <p> However, there are a few exceptions. In this chart, both Drummond Island and Frankfort showed a slight decline in snowfall.</p>

            <h1>A look from further West: Nebraska and Kansas</h1>
            <p>As we look at data from counties from both Kansas and Nebraska, we will observe counties that are not impacted by Lake Effect storms.</p>
            <p>This way we are able to compare data that is not just from one state, but to compare trends from states away.</p>

                <p>As noted in the chart above, it comes clear that the 2021-2022 snow season is remembered as a notable difference from normalcy. Not only did Michigan see a downwards trend in the amount of snow that fell, but Kansas and Nebraska counties experienced a parallel of this pattern. Most counties in Nebraska passed a season that had ten to twenty inches less than they were expected to receive. </p>
                <p>In conclusion, the 2021-2022 snowfall season fell far short of most expectations. While the 2022-2023 season held to its standards, News Sources are starting to question if the downwards trends in snowfall are going to become a permanent change. This 2023-2024 upcoming season is just starting, but it is going to be a prominent one</p>
